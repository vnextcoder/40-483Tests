            <div class="explanation">Children can be told to "flex" (to shrink or grow) according to free space available. The flexxing is relative, so the first item is flexxing to 1/3 and the second item is flexxing to 2/3 of the available space. The third item doesn't flex, so the "available space" is the space remaining after the third item's space is calculated.</div>
